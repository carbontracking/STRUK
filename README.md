# UPSCRIBERS

A web application that makes school better for print-challenged kids (and all the others too). By print-challenged we mean those who are unable to read, or have difficulty reading, printed materials
* Low-vision
* Learning disabilities (dyslexia)
* Neuro-motor

Today students receive learning material in  multiple formats (printed/hand-written/pdf/docx/odt).

This project/webapp will provide the following
* Rapid access to what the student needs
  * Grouping/Filtering of Date/Subject/Topic using meta-data (tagging)
  * A simplified process for conversion to web-native formats (html5/jpeg)
* Simple WYSIWYG transcription (saved as html)
  * Crowd-sourced transcription :  With enough eyes, every kid can read
  * V1.0 : text-entry limited to (h1/h2/h3/lists/bod/italic/underlined) 
  * V2.0 : Integrated OCR to kick-start the transcription process

Accessibility enhancements are
* V1.0 : Font size/color, background color adapted per student
* V2.0 : Text-highlighting as student moves through text
* V2.0 : Text-To-Speech with highlighting

Platform/Tool agnostic : A pure web solution, no plugins, no installation
